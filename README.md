# Dictionary Project

<p>My first solo React project and second in general. It's not ideal because I didn't reach all my goals, but anyway, I am satisfied. To create it, I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>React JS, HTML5 and CSS3.</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS.</li>
<li><a href="https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/example">Dictionary Api</ a></li>
<li>Netlify for hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://incomparable-fairy-68dab3.netlify.app/">Netlify</a></p>
